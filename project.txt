Intro

Stocksplosion is a web app for simplifying your stock market activity.  Featuring a dead simple interface, Stocksplosion
quickly generates a recommendation for you to buy, sell, or hold a particular stock when you enter its name or
stock ticker in the search bar.

Approach

After a careful reading of the Stocksplosion Project Spec, I began formulating a plan of attack.  Given the customer's
focus on ease of use, speed, and ROI, I knew I wanted to keep things simple.  The primary interface would be a search
bar that would allow the user to type either the company name or the stock symbol.  Immediately it was decided that the
search bar would need to feature look-ahead typing to make the site even easier and faster to use.

Once the company was selected, an api call would retrieve the necessary information to populate a graph, a performance
summary, and the buy / sell / hold determination.  A quick search yielded a vast amount of potential algorithms for
predicting the performance of a stock.  Ultimately, none of those approaches were chosen, and instead a naive algorithm
was developed that required only the current and average stock prices.  The algorithm can easily be replaced for
something more sophisticated in the future.

The underlying technology stack chosen was the Angular JS framework due to familiarity.  A few helpful modules were
selected to ease development:  Restangular (easy API calls), Angucomplete-alt (look-ahead searching), and Chart.js
(pretty graphs).

Cost Breakdown

Initial requirements gathering, planning, research (api, stock algorithms): 2 hr
Project setup + initial prototype: 3hr
Project unit testing, refactoring: 3hr
Styling: 2hr
Final report, deployment: 2hr

Total cost: 12 * 150 = 1800
